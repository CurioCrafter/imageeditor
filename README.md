# Advanced Image Editor - Photoshop-Class with AI Microservices

A professional-grade image editor with a hybrid architecture combining local GPU processing with cloud-based AI microservices.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Desktop (Modular "Monolith")
- **UI Shell**: Qt-based cross-platform interface with dockable panels
- **Raster Engine**: GPU-accelerated tile-based processing (Vulkan/Metal/Direct3D)
- **Brush & Paint Engine**: Sub-pixel sampling, blend modes, dynamics
- **Non-destructive Graph**: Layer system with filter and adjustment layers
- **Color Management**: ICC + OCIO for HDR workflows
- **Plugin System**: Python/C++ API for extensibility

### Microservices Backbone
- **AI Inference Services**: Segmentation, inpainting, upscaling, style transfer
- **Collaboration & Presence**: Real-time document editing with CRDT
- **Asset Management**: Version control, deduplication, search
- **Authentication & Licensing**: OAuth, premium feature entitlements

## 🚀 Key Features
