# Development Status - Advanced Image Editor

## 🚧 **Current Status: Core Development Build**

This is a **development build** that focuses on the core engine without requiring Qt6 or other heavy dependencies. It's designed to get you started quickly while we build up the full feature set.

## ✅ **What's Working**

### Core Engine
- ✅ Basic project structure and build system
- ✅ CMake configuration with modular components
- ✅ Core engine library (stub implementation)
- ✅ Command-line interface
- ✅ Configuration system

### Microservices
- ✅ Docker Compose setup
- ✅ AI Inference Service (FastAPI + PyTorch)
- ✅ Basic service structure for all components
- ✅ Infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)

## 🚧 **What's In Progress**

### Missing Dependencies
- ❌ Qt6 (for UI components)
- ❌ Vulkan SDK (for GPU acceleration)
- ❌ STB and OpenEXR libraries
- ❌ Full implementation of core classes

### Implementation Status
- 🔄 Core Engine: Basic structure, needs full implementation
- 🔄 UI Components: Headers defined, implementation pending
- 🔄 GPU Acceleration: Headers defined, implementation pending
- 🔄 AI Integration: Headers defined, implementation pending
- 🔄 Plugin System: Headers defined, implementation pending

## 🚀 **How to Use (Current State)**

### 1. Start Microservices
```cmd
start-services.bat
```

### 2. Build Core Application
```cmd
scripts\build.bat
```

### 3. Run Core Application
```cmd
build\bin\image-editor.exe
```

**Note**: The current build only includes the core engine. You'll see a command-line interface that initializes the core components.

## 🔧 **Next Development Steps**

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Current)
1. **Implement Core Classes**
   - `Engine` class with full functionality
   - `Document` class with layer management
   - `Layer` class with various types
   - Basic image I/O operations

2. **Add Basic Dependencies**
   - Install STB library for image loading
   - Install OpenEXR for HDR support
   - Create basic image processing functions

3. **Test Core Functionality**
   - Document creation and management
   - Basic image operations
   - Layer system operations

### Phase 2: UI Components
1. **Install Qt6**
   - Download and install Qt6.5+
   - Configure CMake to find Qt6
   - Rebuild with `BUILD_UI=ON`

2. **Implement UI Classes**
   - `MainWindow` with basic layout
   - `CanvasWidget` for image display
   - Basic panels and toolbars

### Phase 3: GPU Acceleration
1. **Install Vulkan SDK**
   - Download and install Vulkan SDK
   - Configure CMake to find Vulkan
   - Rebuild with `BUILD_GPU=ON`

2. **Implement GPU Components**
   - Basic renderer
   - Shader management
   - Texture handling

### Phase 4: AI Integration
1. **Test AI Microservices**
   - Verify AI service connectivity
   - Test basic AI operations
   - Rebuild with `BUILD_AI=ON`

## 🛠️ **Build Options**

The current CMake configuration supports these build options:

```cmake
# Core only (current default)
cmake .. -DBUILD_UI=OFF -DBUILD_GPU=OFF -DBUILD_AI=OFF -DBUILD_PLUGINS=OFF

# With UI (requires Qt6)
cmake .. -DBUILD_UI=ON

# With GPU acceleration (requires Vulkan)
cmake .. -DBUILD_GPU=ON

# With AI integration
cmake .. -DBUILD_AI=ON

# Full build (requires all dependencies)
cmake .. -DBUILD_UI=ON -DBUILD_GPU=ON -DBUILD_AI=ON -DBUILD_PLUGINS=ON
```

## 🎯 **Development Goals**

### Short Term (This Week)
- [ ] Implement basic `Engine` class functionality
- [ ] Add STB library for image loading
- [ ] Create basic image processing functions
- [ ] Test core engine operations

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Install Qt6 and implement basic UI
- [ ] Add basic canvas and image display
- [ ] Implement layer management UI
- [ ] Test UI functionality

### Long Term (Next Month)
- [ ] Add GPU acceleration
- [ ] Implement AI integration
- [ ] Add plugin system
- [ ] Performance optimization

## 🆘 **Getting Help**

### Common Issues
1. **Qt6 not found**: Install Qt6 or use `BUILD_UI=OFF`
2. **Vulkan not found**: Install Vulkan SDK or use `BUILD_GPU=OFF`
3. **Build failures**: Check dependencies and use `scripts\install-deps.sh`

### Next Steps
1. Start with the core build: `scripts\build.bat`
2. Test the basic application: `build\bin\image-editor.exe`
3. Install Qt6 when ready for UI development
4. Gradually enable more components as dependencies are installed

---

**Remember**: This is a development build designed for incremental development. Start with the core components and gradually add features as dependencies become available.
